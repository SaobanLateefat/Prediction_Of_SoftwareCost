To address this, we conduct thorough requirement gathering sessions and involve stakeholders early in the process to refine and clarify the project requirements. 

","In our organization, we continuously strive to improve our software cost estimation processes through regular reviews and feedback loops. After completing projects, we conduct post-mortem analysis to identify areas where our estimates were off and to understand the reasons behind any discrepancies. This continuous improvement approach allows us to refine our estimation techniques and learn from past experiences. 

Effective communication with stakeholders is another critical aspect of our estimation process. We emphasize the importance of transparent communication, making sure that stakeholders understand that estimates are approximations subject to change based on various factors.
